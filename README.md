For scenarios genration pass 
    15 for Micro deployment
    150 for Small deployment
    700 for Medium deployment
    1500 for Large deployment
in configrationGenrator( ); function calling from Main function.


create a file PM.txt 
with following line:
PM 16 20 100 10

first value is PM representing physical machine.
second value is CPU units count.
third value is Memory units count.
fourth value is Disk unit count.
fifth value is number of PM.


if your doing Micro deplyment experiments then the fifth value is 10.
For Small deployment experiments fifth value is 100.
For Medium deployment experiments fifth value is 500.
For Large deployment experiments fifth value is 1000.



This project run the three iteration of each algorithm, and output the following values for each iteration against all discussed algorithms.

time : (ms)
Unallocated VMs: 
waste CPU:  Total waste %
waste Memory:  Total waste % 
Waste Disk:  Total waste % 
Free PM: 
Total Bandwidth used
